        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Positivity</h3>
            <p>Try to think positively. Instead of ''I can't do it'', you should think ''I might be able to do at least a part of this! Let's try it!'' for example.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Creativity</h3>
            <p>Be creative. Creative expression and your mental health are linked with each other. You can make some art, write a poem, etc.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Love</h3>
            <p>Express to the people who you love that you love them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Laughing</h3>
            <p>Laugh as much as you can. It has a positive effect on your mental and physical health.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Distraction</h3>
            <p>Find distraction in tough times. Hang out with friends, play games, go outside, and do other things you might enjoy.</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Warm bath</h3>
            <p>Take a relaxing warm bath every week.</p>

            <h3>Forgiving</h3>
