        <h2>Luvlin Mental Health Community Discord Server Guidelines</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Luvlin Mental Health Community Discord server. These guidelines are in place to create a safe and supportive environment for all members. We appreciate your cooperation in maintaining a positive atmosphere within our community.
<br><br>
Our community guidelines are essential to fostering a respectful and secure environment within the Luvlin Mental Health Community. We are dedicated to maintaining a well-moderated platform that promotes a sense of safety and inclusivity. By participating in this community, all members agree to adhere to these guidelines to ensure a harmonious experience for everyone.
<br><br>
Please remember that the intent and spirit of these guidelines hold greater significance than their exact wording. In cases where content or messages are found to violate the underlying principles of these guidelines, appropriate action may be taken.
<br><br>
If any member breaches the Luvlin Mental Health Community guidelines, the moderation team reserves the right to take appropriate measures. These measures may include message removal, enforcing nickname changes, issuing warnings, muting users, imposing (temporary) bans, and reporting violations to Discord's Trust & Safety team. It is important to note that when handling reports, the Luvlin Mental Health Community moderation team may consider off-server content, such as direct messages and interactions in other Discord servers.
